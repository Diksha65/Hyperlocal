**Motiation for this project**

I wanted to buy a study table in Bangalore. I tried ordering online twice but both the times, I received a defective product. I went to supermarkets near by but I could not get the type of table I wanted. One frustrated day, I left my home in search of a study table in stationary shops. But still was unsuccessful. It had been 2 weeks, I was looking for study table of my type. I was frustrated and I wished if I had some app or some solution that could tell me which nearby stores sell study tables and at what prices. Finally I met a helpful man in a store who promised to arrange me a study table and he did. 

After few days, I was thinking on this problem and I discussed it with one of my friends. She also had the same problem. It stuck me that if the solution does not exist as of now, then why not create it.

So I started developing this Mobile App to help people like me get things faster. 

**Features in this app**

1. List of all stores in the city
2. List of all products sold by the store
3. Cost of each product
4. Location of the store ( this will help me calculate the minimum distance between the store and the user )
5. Rating of the store
6. No of pieces for the particular product in the store.
7. Self pick up or online delivery directly from the store
8. Online payment or COD
9. Blocking the product for a particular period of time before it gets out of stock
10. Special discounts from the store (if any)

**Future Aim**

> The website and the mobile app will point to a common database (Firestore)

> I will be building a website where the store people can 
  1. Enter any new products in the store 
  2. Update the price/(items left) for the existing product.
  3. Keep track of their daily earnings
  4. Analyse their selling and improve the type and quality of products
  5. Make more profit!!! (:-P)
