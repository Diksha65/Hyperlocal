Motiation - 

I wanted to buy a study table in Bangalore. I tried ordering online twice but both the times, I received a defective prodduct. I went to supermarkets near by but I could not get the type of table I wanted. One day frustrated, I left my home in search of a study table in stationary shops. But still was un successful. It had been 2 weeks, I was looking for study table of my type. I was frustrated and I wished if I had some app or some solution that could tell me which nearby stores sell study tables and at what prices. Finally I met a helpful man in store who promised to arrange me a study table and he did. 

After few days, I was thinking on this problem and I discussed it with one of my friend.She also had the same problem. It stuck me that if the solution does not exist as of now, then why not create it.

So I started developing this Mobile App to help people like me get things faster.
